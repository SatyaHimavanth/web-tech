<p>Infrastructural Abundance<br>

It is part of the basic policy of the promoters that infrastructural self-sufficiency is a pre-requisite for better productivity and performance in all the activities, more so for academic activities. The Management has always been creating and updating academic and building infrastructure to meet the AICTE norms and standards from time to time and to make life easy and stress-free in the campus.

          Today the campus resembles a park with well laid out black-topped internal roads with avenue trees on either-side. The one k.m. approach road too is a beauty to watch. Every bit of the vacant space is covered with lawns, flower plants and gardens. It is a most environment friendly campus, full of greenery, the hills on the western side adding to the contrast of the panorama.

          The 25-bus exclusive transport saves the students and staff from the vagaries of public transport. A highly subsidized Canteen that serves lunch and stacks, a Dispensary, Bank, a Gymnasium to provide fitness regimen are a few amenities. Four A.C Seminar Halls, an Auditorium, an Open-air Theatre are the venues for co-curricular and extra-curricular events, that make life colourful and enjoyable. Perhaps, there is every facility in the campus that renowned institutes generally provide to its staff and students.</p>
